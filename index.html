                    The Aventador LP700-4 is the first iteration of the Aventador and was designed by Filippo Perini. Production of the Aventador was planned to be limited to 4,000 vehicles; however, in 2016, it achieved the 5,000 unit milestone. The molds used to make the carbon-fibre monocoque are expected to last 500 molds each and only 8 have been made.
